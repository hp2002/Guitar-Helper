# Gelp
A creative tool that allows user to design the fretboard of their choice and help them play along with ease.
# Installation
You would be required to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this application
# Features
New guitar players usually use online images of fretboards to finds the notes in the key they're trying to play, which is time consuming and is valuable time wasted in making redundant google searches!

Gelp allows you to choose notes of a key in any order and displays a fretboard with the location of the notes you wish to see! This would help any guitar player focus on the important notes and learn at faster pace. *(The current version of Gelp displays the fretboard on a command line interface which would change in the future.)*

A simple use case of this application would be using it to make an indie melody on guitar. You would design a chord progression and use the corresponding numbers of the chords in the key as inputs, and voil√† you have all the places on the fretboard that would act as an anchor when youre transposing a riff. You can also have all the notes in the key which would guide you to stay within the key.

2. Run the following command to execute the *main.py* file

5. Great! Now you see all the chords, notes and numbers associated with the notes. Choose a chord progression you like! This would determine the melody and feel of the song. The minor chords sound sad and nostalgic while the major chords sound happy and poppy. A good combination of both would create good music. Lets go with the chords F#, A#m and B! Input the numbers corresponding to the chords in any order.

6. There you go! You have a custom fretboard with the notes you wish to play with the song, Enjoy!

# Future improvements

* Use of graphics to draw the fretboard instead of the command line interface
* Options of major and minor keys for music composing
* Scalaing the application and adding more features like note recognition, metronome, note synthesis, etc.
* Adding support for other musical instruments
